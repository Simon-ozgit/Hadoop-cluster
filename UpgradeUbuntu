Some of the nodes with different java versions
Cannot run spark properly.
$ java -version
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt dist-upgrade
$ sudo apt autoremove
$ sudo apt install update-manager-core

Now reboot every node from edge node
$ ssh –t user@server.com ‘sudo reboot’

Upgrade to newest version
$ sudo do-release-upgrade

Note if upgrade is doing via ssh, it will prompt that 
"This session appears to be running under ssh. It is not recommended to perform a upgrade over ssh currently because it is harder to recover in case of failure. "
So it's better to follow the recommendation.

If continue, it will prompt that:

"To make recovery in case of failure easier, an additional sshd will 
be started on port '1022'. If anything goes wrong with the running 
ssh you can still connect to the additional one. 
If you run a firewall, you may need to temporarily open this port. As 
this is potentially dangerous it's not done automatically. You can 
open the port with e.g.: 
'iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1022 -j ACCEPT' 

To continue please press [ENTER]"

Then following the prompt to finish upgrade.
