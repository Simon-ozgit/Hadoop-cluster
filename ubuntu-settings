Disable IPV6
According to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11890, IPV6 needs to be disabled.
To disable IPV6, append the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf

# disable ipv6
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1
# end of disable ipv6

Need to make this changes on all nodes in a cluster
